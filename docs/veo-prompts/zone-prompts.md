## 1. Sky Zone
```
Warm California coastal morning sky with soft cumulus clouds drifting slowly 
from left to right. Golden sunlight filters through, creating god rays. 
A few distant seabirds glide peacefully. Camera static, looking up at sky.

Pixar-quality environmental rendering. Seamless 8-second loop.
```

## 2. Forest Zone  
```
Interior of a coastal redwood forest, camera looking up through towering 
tree trunks. Dappled sunlight filters through the canopy, creating moving 
light patterns on the forest floor. Gentle breeze causes branches to sway 
slightly. Dust particles float in light beams. Warm earth tones: sage greens, 
amber browns, soft golden light. Pixar-quality environmental rendering.
Seamless 8-second loop.
```

## 3. Rocky Climb Zone
```
Rugged Big Sur coastal terrain, rocky outcrops with wind-swept grasses. 
Dramatic clouds move across the sky. Camera slow pan across weathered 
granite and terracotta-colored earth. Occasional grass movement from 
ocean breeze. Warm afternoon light. Colors: tans, terracottas, sage greens, 
weathered grays. Pixar-quality environmental rendering.
Seamless 8-second loop.
```

## 4. Coastal Overlook Zone
```
Breathtaking view from Big Sur cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. 
Waves crash against rocks below in rhythmic motion. Golden hour sunlight 
reflects off water surface. Distant fog bank on horizon. Camera static, 
cinematic wide shot. Colors: deep ocean blues, golden light, misty grays.
Pixar-quality environmental rendering. Seamless 8-second loop.
```

## 5. Underground Roots Zone
```
Cross-section view of rich dark soil with intricate root systems of 
redwood trees. Subtle movement: roots slowly growing, earthworms moving 
through soil, moisture glistening. Shafts of dim light from above. 
Organic textures. Colors: rich browns, deep amber, dark soil tones.
Pixar-quality environmental rendering. Seamless 8-second loop.
```

## 6. Underground Burrows Zone
```
Network of underground tunnels dug by groundhogs, earthy walls with 
visible roots poking through. Dust particles floating in dim light 
shafts from above. Subtle signs of activity: small paw prints appearing, 
shadows of movement. Mysterious but inviting. Colors: underground browns, 
amber accents, hints of warmth. Pixar-quality environmental rendering.

## 7. Secret Data Center (HERO - Generate First)
```
Cozy underground data center staffed by cartoon groundhogs in lab coats. 
Server racks with blinking blue LEDs line the walls. Warm overhead lamp 
pools create cozy lighting. Multiple groundhog characters: one carrying 
coffee tray walks across frame, another types at workstation, one checks 
server panel with clipboard, one sings into microphone near a terminal.
Green monitor glows, ambient tech sounds implied. Whimsical Pixar-style, 
warm and inviting bunker aesthetic. Camera static wide shot showing 
full scene. Seamless 8-second loop.
